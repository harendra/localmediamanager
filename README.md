Simple Application to manage your local media (videos) using browser interface

LocalMediaManager is a python application (python 2.7) that scans specified folders (and subfolders) for media files and indexes them. While indexing it takes
several screenshots of all the files found and dumps all the information in a json file. You can then just open index.html file and manage all your media through browser. No installation required.
